## My Process:

I developed the project over the course of approximately A week and a half. In order to learn as much as I can from the development of this project, I implemented certain features from scratch including accessible and scrollable tabs, a carousel functionality, and infinite loading.

### Tools.

After designing a prototype of the application using Adobe XD, I started developing the app using the following technologies:

- Next.js. 
- Spotify API.
- NextAuth.
- RecoilJS for State Management.
- Tailwind.
